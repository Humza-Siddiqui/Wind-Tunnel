									<h3>Introduction</h3>
									<p> 
									Main objective of this lab was to see how the Cl and Cd varies with addition of different
										types of winglets to the Eppler 212 finite wing. Firstly, to account for gravity bias we run the
										wind tunnel at 10 Hz and record the normal and axial forces going from-15째 to 25째. Then we
										insert Eppler 212 without winglets and record the axial and normal forces at-15째 to 25째.
										This process is repeated for Re  = 100 k and 200 K. Then the winglet is added to Eppler 212 and
										the process is repeated again. Winglets belong to 3 families. 1- Different positions. 2
									   Different angles. 3- Different lengths. In total 3 winglets are tested from each family. Drag polar 
										graph was plotted for each winglet. From the graph we can see that the best winglet
										was 60 deg since it had higher Cl value at Re 100 K and 200 K. Also 60 deg winglets had
										lower Cd values for both 100 K and 200 K Re. We could also see that Cl increases with an
										increase in Re. And Cd decreases with an increase Re. In conclusion Re has a positive
										relation with Cl and a negative relation with Cd. So from this experiment we can conclude
										that higher angle, short length and mid position gives us the best results from all 3 families.</p>

										<p>From figure 1 we can see that a total of 10 different wingelt types were used for each Reynolds number. Then from this we determined which winglet produced the best results.</p>

									<h6> Figure 3 (Drag polar for different position winglets)</h6>		
									<p>From figure 3 we can conclude that put of all 3 positions mid position gives us the best results. But 
									     the result of no winglet is still better. Since no winglet has low Cd at both Re 100 K and 200 K
										and high Cl at 100 K. Only at 200 K mid winglets has better Cl then no winglet. So we can conclude that no winglet is the better option.</p>

									<h6> Figure 4 (Drag polar for different size winglets)</h6>	
									<p> From figure 4 we can conclude that no winglet performed the best when compared to the others. But
										if we have to use winglets we can use short size since it has the least Cd. None of the lengths contributed to increasing the Cl of
										Eppler 212.</p>
									<img src="images/DP angle.png" controls width = "900" height = "350" >
									<h6> Figure 5 (Drag polar for different angle winglets)</h6>		
									<p>  From figure 5 we can conclude that the 60 degree winglet is the most effective winglet angle from
										this family. Since it has the highest Cl and the lowest Cd for both the Re values.</p>

										<h3>Conclusion</h3>		
										<p> We can conclude that the most optimal winglet would have a short length of about 1.84 inches and
											be positioned in the middle of the wing. This winglet should have an angle of 60 degrees. This winglet would have
											low induced drag due to the wing tips altering the shape of the vortices behind the wing. Also the friction drag would be
											low since the wing is short and would have less area exposed to the incoming flow which does increase the skin friction
											drag but not by a lot. Lastly, the wing will have a higher stall angle so it can maneuver better in the flow. This wing would
											make it so the fuel consumption is low hence more economical.</p>
